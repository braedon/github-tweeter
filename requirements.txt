# bottle==0.12.17
# The way Bottle currently handles error doesn't allow logging
# middleware to log them correctly, so used a patched version.
# NOTE: This won't override a previously installed version of Bottle,
#       so remove first with:
# 		> pip3 uninstall bottle

# Require simplejson to ensure it's available for Bottle to use. If it's not

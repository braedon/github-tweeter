# bottle==0.13
# The way Bottle currently handles errors doesn't allow logging
# middleware to log them correctly, so used a patched version.
# NOTE: This won't override a previously installed version of Bottle,
#       so remove first with:
#       > pip3 uninstall bottle

# Require simplejson to ensure it's available for Bottle to use. If it's not
# available Bottle will try and use the builtin json module, causing ambiguity
# as to which module's JSONDecodeError exceptions need to be caught.
